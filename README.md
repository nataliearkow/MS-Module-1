# Module_1_Challenge
Michigan State - Full Stack Bootcamp - Module 1 Challenge - HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## About

To help the marketing agency meet their needs by refactoring the given code to meet the requirements for the Acceptance Criteria.

## Given - "User Story"

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Given - "Acceptance Criteria"

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Process

Went through the index.html and style.css to see what adjusting to the code had to be done.

## Changes

Fixed "title" - orginally too generic, adjusted "div" tags to more specific ones (header, nav, section, article, aside, footer), changed headers (h3 tags to h2 tags) and adjusted fonts (for better design and structure), for images, added "alt" text, fixed CSS (reorganized to html sections and prevented repetition), added multiple "id" tags, & commented on HTML and CSS.
